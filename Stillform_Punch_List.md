## NOT YET TESTABLE (needs more data or specific conditions)

- Ghost Echo — needs sessions with positive deltas first
- Somatic Interrupt — needs fast typing in Reframe
- Pattern Analysis — needs 3+ Pulse entries or 5+ sessions
- 7-session AI review — needs 7 completed sessions
- EOD check-in — only visible after 6 PM
- Trial expiration — wait 14 days or manually set stillform_trial_start in DevTools

---

## KNOWN ISSUES

- Paywall is localStorage honor system — server-side verification planned
- Annual checkout link is same URL as monthly (both variants on one page) — by design
- Chrome 146 changed "Install app" to "Add to Home Screen" — Chrome UI change, not bug
- beforeinstallprompt may not fire on repeated install/uninstall — Chrome throttle
